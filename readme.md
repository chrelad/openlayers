# OpenLayers 3

This document describes a bit about the work going toward OpenLayers 3.0.

OpenLayers v3 development is taking place in git, with a central repository
hosted on [GitHub][1].  To contribute to development, it's important to be 
comfortable working with git.  The [help pages][2] on GitHub provide a nice 
starting place for this.

The repository contains a master branch and a 2.x branch.  Other branches may 
come and go as people work on specific features.  The master branch should be 
the closest stable thing to OpenLayers 3.0 (and this readme should get updated
before 3.0 is released).  However, at any time before the 3.0 release, the 
master branch should not be considered production ready.  The 2.x branch is used 
to merge in changes from any ongoing development in the v2 line of development.

If you are interested in contributing, please fork the central repository, make
changes, and issue a pull request.  We may change the process along the way, but
for now, developers with access to the subversion trunk will be able to push to
the central git repository.  We welcome your contributions and thank you for 
helping us work toward OpenLayers 3.
